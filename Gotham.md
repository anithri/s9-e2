Gotham! an Exponential Chaos game
=================================

A slow fuse is burning in Gotham City.Gangs run amok, Super Villains wreak havok, and monsters roam the streets.  Only Batman and his allies stand between Gotham and chaos.  Gotham! is the story of one night in this exciting town.  In this one night, the mob and gang warfare will spill into the streets, on this one night, Disaster strikes the city, and this same night A super villain will strike, hoping to bring the Dark Knight Detective down once and for all.

The Gameboard will represent the city.  from Gotham Heights to the docks, From Arkham Island to the spires of the Financial District.  With special areas like Gotham Central, the Batcave, Crime Alley and Blackgate prison.

Each player will choose 1 of Batman  or his allies: Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, Huntress, or Oracle.  Each character has a certain number of points to spend on 4 dice pools:  Detective, Guts, Bravery, and Gadgets (which can be used as a wild card for any of the three categories) .  A players turn gives him a number of actions which he can spend on movement, replenishment, quelling violence (vs the gangs), investigating crimes (vs the supervillains), and helping the citizens of Gotham (helping against disaster).

The game plays against them via a event card deck.  The board is seeded with a number of gang members on the streets.  Each turn, 1 or more cards are drawn which could have the effect of 1.  Gang members increase/spread, Tragedy strikes, Super villains advance their plots, and maybe a few things that are good for the heroes as well.

There heroes can only win by preventing an disaster from getting too bad, by keeping the mob violence to a minimum, and by foiling the super villains plot before it succeeds.

The Map will have a number of Regions, and each region will have 9 regular spaces, one of which is special.  Each region will be connected to 2 or more other regions such that 1 space of one region will connect to another space on a different region.  Movement from space to space costs 1 turn, movement across a region costs 1 turn and will end your turn.

Each player will be rated as weak, average, and strong across 4 different skills.  Detective, which helps a player solve the super villains crimes.  Fighting which helps quell the street crime and violence.  Guts which helps you face the disasters befalling Gotham.  And Gadgets (those wonderful toys) which is an expendable resource that can be applied to any of the other skills, but each usage reduces its effectiveness.

The Game has 3 opposition points:
- Street Crime and violence:
  - Small pockets of violence spread throughout the city.
  - Start small and escalates.
  - starts with a small number of pockets already seeded
  - eventually spreads to nearby spaces.
- Disaster:
  - Burning buildings, out of control super villains, explosions and other calamaties.
  - only happen in one place at a time, but will escalate much faster when it does.
- Super Villain Crime Spree:
  - starts with an event
  - player finds out it happened only after at least the second event kicks off.
  - each event happens in a different region of the city.  
  - The player must track the crimes to the villain causing them

Each turn happens as follows:
  - Mobs get worse.  One or more region/spaces are selected, (one per mob of XXX size):
    - If the space is not adjacent to an existing mob, nothing happens 
    - If the space is unoccupied, adjacent to an occupied space, and at least 1 player is in the region, nothing happens
    - If the space is unoccupied, adjacent to an occupied space, and no player is in the region, the space turns into the lowest level of mob.
    - If the space is occupied, annd the space is not at the maximum level of mob, the mob levels increases 1 step.
    - If the space is occupied, and the space is at the maximum level of mob, then every adjacent space has its level increased by 1.
  - Disasters get worse.
    - 2 spaces are selected for the region that the disaster is in.  Disaster spaces get worse as for mobs.
    - Additionally the original disaster area increase in level by a step. 
    - No further spreading happens once the original disaster is removed.
  - Player actions.  A player recieves XXXX actions per turn, and may use them in any order.
    - Play a card.
    - move 1 space.
    - Fight street crime. Make a test to reduce the mob level of the space you are in.
    - Rescue Civilians. Make a test to reduce the disaster level of the space you are in.
    - Investigate Crime. Make a test to discover a crime scene and discover next crime region.
    - Analyze clues. learn which spaces the crime did not take place in.
    - Capture Villain (ends turn)
    - move 1 region (ends turn)
  - Card phase:
    - A card is drawn, and any events (hidden or otherwise) are resolved, 
    - otherwise the card goes into the hand of the player.  
    - A player may have XXXX number of cards.  
    - Any cards in excess of that number must be discarded at the end of the turn.
